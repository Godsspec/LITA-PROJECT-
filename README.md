- Microsoft Excel: Ms Excel 2010 was used to clean, explore and create pivot tables from the data
- Structured Query Language: SQL SSMS was used to write queries in order to draw insights from the data
- Power BI: This was used to visualize the data for better understanding of patterns, trends and deduction of occurences observed in the data.
- Github; for portfolio building

## Data Cleaning and Preparation

2. Structured Query Language; SSMS was used to write queries allowing for insights to be drawn from the data
3. Power BI; to summarize and visualize the data using different visual models

### MS Excel
------------
Pivot tables created from the exploration of the data are seen below
