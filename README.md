# LITA-PROJECT-
This displays the application of knowledge received during Data analysis classes at Incubator hub
## Project Title 1: HR Data Analysis

## Project Overview
------------------
This analysis was done based on the information gathered about a particular company in other to know the state of the company's man-power strength via its skilled staffs/current employee, their age-range, attitude towards job and job roles.

## Data Analysis Tools Used
----------------------
- Microsoft Excel: Ms Excel 2010 was used to clean, explore and create pivot tables from the data
- Power BI: This was used to visualize the data for better understanding of patterns, trends and deduction of occurences observed in the data.
- Github; for portfolio building

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
---------------------
In the initial Phase of the Data Cleaning and preparations, we perform the following action after uploading the file from the Learning Management System (LMS);
- Data loading and inspection
- Handling missing variables
- Data Cleaning and inspectioni) Data was uploaded from the Learning Management System (LMS)
 

## Exploratory Data Analysis
-----------------------
EDA was implored to extract insights from the data through insightful questions such as;
i) What is the Total Number of Attrition Count?
ii) What is the Total Number of Current Employee?
iii) Average age of Employee?
iv) Attrition Rate
v) Job role Satisfaction
vi) Marital Status of Employee

## Data Visualization
--------------------
Power BI was used to visualize the explored data after transforming the data from Ms Excel through different visualization models which has been uploaded as files.



## Project Title 2: Sales Data Analysis

## Overview
-----------
Sales made by a wholesale/retail store selling clothings (such as-Gloves, Hat, Jacket, Shirt, Shoes and Socks) across the regions of Nigeria ( North, South, East and West) between 2023/2024 was analysed to know if the choice of business was a good or bad choice, if it is a profitable business via the revenues incurred and also the product yielding the largest sales.

## Data Analysis Tools
--------------
Analysis tools used were; 
1. MS Excel 2010; to clean and explore data using excel fuctions to answer probing questions, creating pivot tables to summarize the entire data
2. Structured Query Language; SSMS was used to write queries allowing for insights to be drawn from the data
3. Power BI; to summarize and visualize the data using different visual models

### MS Excel
------------
1. Pivot tables created from the exploration of the data are seen below
